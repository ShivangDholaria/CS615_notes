First, do no harm
You have responsibility when you are sys admin
Having elevated privs mean you can do many things that could be morally wrong but fun
Sys admin is someone who manages other's data
Being legal is not always being ethical
Place public interest above everything, even personal, business, and sectional interest
Different organisations have different codes of ethic but are in general one and the same
Diff words, same meaning
Laws and policies are the driving factor of any organisation
Sys admin is privileged position, making you a target, need to make rational decisions, face tought choices, need to act in user's interest
Dunno what to do, ask more, seek clarification, express concerns, get in WRITING, keep records/trials, identify allies/good peeps/etc
Ask peeps about what is right and what is wrong, do it in meeting or private talks, tell how the products benefits the users and what are the side effects
End of the day, Do a GOOD JOB!
