Networking:
	OSI Model - 7 layers - from top to bottom - Application, presentation, session, transport, network, link and physical
	TCP/IP Model - 4 layers - from top to bottom - Application, transport, internet, link

IPv4 address:
	32 bit long address divided into 4 octets presenting the address
	Divided into 2 parts: Network and host, to identify where it resides. If the network part match, then system can communicate without routers, else router is needed

Network is a network and computer is a computer.
There is no "Cloud" computer network, its just other people's computer.
Network grows as more systems gets interconnected.
Ases get their numbers assigned by IANA which assigns IPs.
"whois" tools helps in getting the AS number.
Peering is the connection used between different ASes to exhange information amoung eachother via BGP.
Peering is done at specific geographic points around the world. PeeringDB can give us the info about different IXPs or Internet eXchange Points.


tcpdump cannot be used by normal user as in a multi-user environment, user can see other user's data flowing in the network.
